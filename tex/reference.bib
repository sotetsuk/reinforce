  abstract  = "The significantly expanded and updated new edition of a widely
               used text on reinforcement learning, one of the most active
               research areas in artificial intelligence.Reinforcement
               learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial
               intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an
               agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives
               while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In
               Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide
               a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and
               algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded
               and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of
               other topics.Like the first edition, this second edition focuses
               on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical
               material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of
               reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the
               tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many
               algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition,
               including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II
               extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections
               on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier
               basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and
               policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on
               reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and
               neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter
               including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM
               Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the
               future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.",
